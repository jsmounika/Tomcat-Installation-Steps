Install tomcat server in aws linux
----------------------------------
1. Go to tomcat.apache.org/download and find the latest stable version of tomcat, Get the URL address of "tar.gz" file. (Right click on the tar.gz file and select copy link address)
	Ex: https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.73/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.73.tar.gz
2. Enter as root user by running 
	sudo -i
3. Run this command - 
	wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.41/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.41.tar.gz
4. Extract TAR file.
   Go to /usr/local or /usr/shared 
	cd /usr/local
   Then extract the TAR file you downloaded in previous step.
	tar -xvf <path of tar file>
	Ex: tar -xvf /root/apache-tomcat-9.0.41.tar.gz  (here tar file is present in /root/ , so mentioned 	/root/apache-tomcat-9.0.41.tar.gz)
5. Go to conf folder inside apache tomcat and open tomcat-users.xml file
	cd apache-tomcat-9.0.41
	cd conf
	vi tomcat-users.xml
6. Press i to enter into insert mode. then replace the roles with below roles -
	<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  	<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  	<role rolename="manager-script"/>
  	<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script"/>
7. Press ESC to exit from insert mode in vi editor. then type :wq to save the file and exit.
8. Now we have to find context.xml files and need to comment Valve tag. To find those file run below command-
	find ~ / -name context.xml 
It will show below files-
	/usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.73/conf/context.xml
	/usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.73/webapps/docs/META-INF/context.xml
	/usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.73/webapps/examples/META-INF/context.xml
	/usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.73/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
	/usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.73/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
Open the above files in vi editor (The first conf/context.xml file don't have Valve tag, so no need to do anything in that file) -
 	vi /usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.73/webapps/docs/META-INF/context.xml
And comment Valve tage as shown below and save & exit (:wq) -
	<!--  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
  		allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->
9. If we want to change default port number of tomcat server, then we can change it with server.xml file present in conf folder.
	vi server.xml
Go to this line and change port number if you want to change port - 
	<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443" />
10. Run the tomcat by going inside bin directory-
	cd /usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.73/bin
	sh start.sh
11. Go to browser and check the server running
	Ex: 3.210.204.123:8080/
12. Click on Manager app to see the applications deployed over there. It will ask for credentials, provide the credentials you have mentioned in tomcat-users.xml file (under user tag) (here username and password we have mentioned are tomcat).
13. To stop the tomcat, use below command -
	cd /usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.73/bin
	sh shutdown.sh
